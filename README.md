cmutils
=======

Utilities for analyzing, plotting, animating and manipulating data from contMech simulations.

Usage
-----
These Python modules mostly contain convenient functions to use in an IPython instance in a terminal window.

cmutils.py
----------
Miscellaneous functions for input, output, manipulation and simple plotting.
Very powerful in combinations with numpy's and scipy's standard manipulation and statistics tools.

cmanim.py
---------
An easy-to-use library for animating simulation results.
The focus is on fully automatic usage, Specifying custom parameters and animating more specific things is possible but currently rather inconvenient.
